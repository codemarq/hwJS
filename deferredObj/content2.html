    It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time. I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard. That's my son, you pothead! We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook.

    He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one. What's up, fizz-ellas. Look at us, crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp. Yes. Lindsay and I are planning a night of heterosexual intercourse. Come on, this is a Bluth family celebration. It's no place for children. You don't want a hungry dove down your pants. She tried pesto for the first time. Imagine that, 92 years old and she never tried pesto.

    Someone order 140 pounds of upper body strength? Quicken! Premiere! [sniffs hand] Oh, God. I'm going to run this through again on "pots and pans." Absolutely. And we're going to be here every day. I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman's terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. I [bleeped] the business model. Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms. You boys know how to shovel coal?

    No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months. Come on! See for more good stuff. We have unlimited juice? This party is going to be off the hook. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts.

    I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals. What do you expect, Mother? I'm half machine! I'm a monster!! If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. What do you expect, Mother? I'm half machine! I'm a monster!! Let the great experiment begin! What have we always said is the most important thing? If that man's straight, then I am sober.

    It's The Final Countdown. Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. I deceived you, mom. Tricked makes it sound like we have a playful relationship. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt?

    The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Heyyyyy campers! If that man's straight, then I am sober.

    I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had. If I wanted something your thumb touched I'd eat the inside of your ear. It's a wonderful restaurant! I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror.

    He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you.

    If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. [earlier] I don't care for Gob. Sorry, some of my students are arguing the significance of the shankbone on the seder plate. But we do not - NOT wag our genitals at one another to make a point. I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. WHY was this show cancelled? I mean, COME ON. Go ahead, touch the cornballer. Yeah, like anyone would want to R her. Well excuse me, Judge Reinhold!
